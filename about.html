                &emsp; I'm a PHP developer from the Philippines. I am originally from Cebu then I moved to another city,
                Makati, to work for a company called <a href="https://finder.com.au">finder.com.au</a>. Before that, I was
                only able to work at this one company in Cebu, an outsourcing company. Pretty much, that is where I learned
                mostly the basics. I was also able to explore other language and this is C#. It is an interesting language
                but I don't think that it is for me. I don't really find the comfort of coding in it, of course this is
                just a personal point of view. I am feeling more at home with PHP. So with this, as what one of our core
                values say at finder, I decided to "Focus on one thing and master that craft".
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; I like exploring new things and experiencing new adventures. I find it discouraging if I would be
                stuck coding the same style over and over again, I get easily bored with that. But since we're in the
                technology industry there's always gonna be new things to learn from and it will never ran out, you just
                need to know on how to keep up. On the side note, I'm not that good with the designs and ux. I am mostly
                into logic and data from behind the scene. And this is the main reason why I'm sticking around with programming.
                I like learning how things work and I analyze how each pieces fit together to make one very particular
                task work, though in programming terms like this is called 'debugging'.
