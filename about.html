                &emsp; I'm a PHP developer from the Philippines. I'm originally from Cebu then I moved to another city
            which is Makati to work on a company called <a href="https://finder.com.au">finder.com.au</a>. Before that,
            I was only able to work to one another company in Cebu, an outsourcing company. There pretty much is where I
            learned mostly the basics. I was also able to explore other language and this is C#. It's also an interesting laguage
            but I don't really think it's for me. I don't really find the comfort of coding in it but this is just a personal
            point of view, I'm feeling more at home with PHP. So with this I decided to focus on one thing and master that
            craft, as what one of our core values say at finder.

                &emsp; I like exploring new things and experiencing new adventures. I find it really discouraging if I would
                be stuck coding the same style over and over again, I get easily bored with that. But since we're in the technology
                industry there's always gonna be new things to learn from and it will never ran out, you just need to learn on how to
                keep up. On the side note, I'm not really that good with the designs and ux. I'm mostly into the logic and
                data from behind the scene. And this is the main reason why I got to stick around with programming. I like
                learning how things work and I like analysing how each pieces fits together to make one very particular task work,
                though in programming terms this is called debugging.
