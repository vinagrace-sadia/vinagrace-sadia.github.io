                    &emsp; An online hardware or home decor store base in Sweden. This is one of my first big projects. I was
                    a backend developer here but using the C# as our primary language. I'm part of the team who did a
                    web application project where you can design and decorate a room as to your liking and purchase the equipments
                    directly from the site.

                    &emsp; A PHP base web application that was locally used by the company Aboitiz. This is a meeting
                    room reservation system. My role here was to maintain and fix the speed of the site. An issue mainly
                    with the querying of data is causing the site to load slowly so I was able to update that and fix
                    any other existing issue. This was an existing project and they were using vanilla PHP here.

                    compares various products to help users get an informed decision. I was able to work on the shopping
                    and technology niche which covers the comparison of shopping deals, mobile phone, mobile plans, broadband plans,
                    and nbn internet. My role here is a backend developer. I was able to work with lots of APIs and even a little
                    React.js. We also uses wordpress as our cms.
