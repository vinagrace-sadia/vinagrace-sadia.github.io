                    A comparison website based in Australia and we're using PHP as our main language here.
                    This site compares various products to help users get an informed decision. I am able to work on
                    the shopping and technology niche which covers the comparison of shopping deals, mobile phones,
                    mobile plans, broadband plans, and nbn internet. My role here is a backend developer. I am able to
                    work with lots of APIs and even a little react.js. We also use wordpress as our cms.

                    An online hardware or home decor store based in Sweden. This is one of my first big projects.
                    I was a backend developer there but using C# as our primary language. I'm part of the team who did a
                    web application project where one can design and decorate a room as to one's liking and purchase the
                    equipments directly from the site.

                    A PHP based web application that was locally used by the company Aboitiz. It was a meeting
                    room reservation system. My role there was to maintain and fix the speed of the site. An issue mainly
                    with the querying of data that is causing the site to load slowly so I was able to update it and
                    fixed any other existing issue. This was an existing project and they were using vanilla PHP.
